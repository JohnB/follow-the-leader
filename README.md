# follow-the-leader

App to allow you to inform your friends of your current location.

### Features

* Two choices: Lead or Follow

A leader must login via twitter, provide a password for their friends to use and enable location tracking.
From that point onward, unless they pause or log out, they will be broadcasting their physical location to all their
 followers.

A follower is given a list of leaders to choose from and, when they pick one, are required to enter the leader's
password. At this point they are shown a map centered on the leader's location.
